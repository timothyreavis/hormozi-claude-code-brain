# The Hormozi Brain Toolkit for Claude Code

## Native Codex skill

This fork adds `$hormozi-brain` while retaining the upstream playbooks, prompts, transcripts, and Claude Code setup. The native entrypoint is `SKILL.md`; it loads only the resources relevant to your request.

Clone this fork to a durable folder, then link it into Codex's user skill directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timothyreavis/hormozi-claude-code-brain.git ~/dev/hormozi-claude-code-brain
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
ln -s ~/dev/hormozi-claude-code-brain ~/.agents/skills/hormozi-brain
```

If the destination already exists, inspect it and back it up before replacing it. Use one install location to avoid duplicate skill entries. Do not link a temporary worktree that will later be removed. Codex supports [symlinked skill folders](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

Start a fresh Codex session and invoke `$hormozi-brain` from any project. No compiled document, project switch, or manual CLAUDE.md instruction is needed. The existing project hooks are not installed globally.

Before an update, check that the checkout is clean, fetch the fork, inspect the exact change, and fast-forward to the reviewed revision. The link uses that checkout directly. To uninstall, remove only the `~/.agents/skills/hormozi-brain` symlink; the source checkout remains intact.

Upstream source: `antonio-clicktoclose/hormozi-claude-code-brain`, reviewed at `3167733e566504a717b8051c176c730e02271f69` on September 12, 2026. The native wrapper is maintained in this fork. The reference collection remains unchanged.

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonio-clicktoclose/hormozi-claude-code-brain.git
```

### 2. Open it in Claude Code

```bash
cd hormozi-claude-code-brain
claude
```

That's it. The `CLAUDE.md` file tells Claude Code where everything is and how to use it. Start asking questions.

### 3. Try your first query

```
Based on Hormozi's $100M Offers pricing framework, build me a
Grand Slam Offer for my [fitness coaching / marketing agency /
SaaS product]. I currently charge $2,000/month.
```

Or use any of the pre-built prompts in the `prompts/` folder.

## Example Queries

Once you're inside Claude Code with this repo, try:

**Offer creation:**
> "Using the Pricing and Fast Cash playbooks, help me create an offer for my coaching business that I can sell for $5,000+"

**Sales scripts:**
> "Read the Closing playbook and write me a 15-minute discovery call script for selling a $10,000 marketing service"

**Scaling advice:**
> "I'm at $800K/year revenue. Read the relevant scaling stage transcript and tell me exactly what I should focus on next"

**Ad copy:**
> "Using the GOATed Ads and Hooks playbooks, write me 5 Facebook ad hooks for a weight loss coaching program"

**Retention:**
> "Read the Retention and Lifetime Value playbooks. My coaching clients churn after 3 months. Give me a plan to double LTV"

## Add Your Own Knowledge

The real power comes from combining Hormozi's frameworks with YOUR business data. Create additional files:

```
my-business/
  case-studies.md       # Your client results
  icp.md                # Your ideal customer profile
  offer-details.md      # Your current offer breakdown
  objections.md         # Common objections you hear
  sales-data.md         # Your numbers (close rate, LTV, etc.)
```

Then update `CLAUDE.md` to reference your files. Now Claude doesn't just know Hormozi's frameworks, it knows YOUR business too.

## Want This Built For You?

This toolkit gives you the playbooks. But reading a playbook and building the infrastructure are two different things.

If you want someone to actually implement systematic selling infrastructure for your high-ticket business (not just hand you frameworks, but build the sales team, CRM, tracking, and automation that runs without you)...

**[Book a call with ClickToClose](https://clicktoclose.ai)**

We scaled V Shred from $0 to $150M+ in 36 months using these exact systems. We can do the same for you.
